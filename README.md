# PeasyCam3
A mouse driven camera-control library for 3D Processing sketches.

This library is based on the original [PeasyCam](https://github.com/jdf/peasycam) by [Jonathan Feinberg](http://mrfeinberg.com) and combines new useful features with the great look and feel of the original version.

It is designed to be in sync with the javascript version for p5.js (TODO: add repo,link, etc...).
